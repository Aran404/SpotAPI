# Welcome to SpotAPI

This Python library is designed to interact with the private and public Spotify APIs, emulating the requests typically made through a web browser. This wrapper provides a convenient way to access Spotify’s rich set of features programmatically.

Note: This project is intended solely for educational purposes and should be used responsibly. Accessing private endpoints and scraping data without proper authorization may violate Spotify's terms of service.
